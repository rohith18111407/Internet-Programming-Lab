        Array
        <pre>
            An 
            array 
            is a collection of
            items stored at 
            contiguous memory locations.
            Items of the same type together.
            This makes it easier to 
            calculate the position of each element
            by simply adding an offset to  a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array

        Linked list
        <pre>
            Linked 
            List 
            is 
            a 
            linear
            data structure,



            in which elements are not stored 


            at a contiguous location, rather they are linked


            using pointers. Linked list forms a series of connected nodes,


            where each node stores the data and the address of the next node.

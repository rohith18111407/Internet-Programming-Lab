                <p>In botany, a <span>TREE</span> is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, usually supporting branches and leaves. In some usages, the definition of a <span>TREE</span> may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. In wider definitions, the taller palms. <span>TREE</span> ferns, bananas, and bamboos are also trees. Trees are not a monophyletic taxonomic group but consist of a wide variety of plant species that have independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. The majority of <span>TREE</span> species are angiosperms or hardwoods; of the rest. many are gymnosperms or softwoods. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are around three trillion mature trees in the world.</p>
